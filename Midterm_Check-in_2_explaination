Description (What it does / how it works):

My generator creates roguelike level-up abilities as structured upgrade cards. Each generated ability is assembled from modular components:

Verb (core action, e.g., damage, shield, dash)

Modifier(s) (shape/scale changes, e.g., chain, area, lifesteal)

Trigger (optional timing, e.g., on hit, on kill)

Constraint / Trade-off (a downside required for stronger effects)

The prototype uses weighted random selection plus simple rules:

Higher Risk increases the severity and frequency of trade-offs, and allows stronger modifiers.

Higher Complexity allows more components per ability (e.g., multiple modifiers / triggers).

Synergy Bias optionally favors tags that match an existing “build tag” (e.g., lightning, bleed).

The tool outputs readable upgrade cards that can be repeatedly generated and used as a design space exploration tool for roguelike progression systems.

Intended Parameters (short list)

Risk Level (Low / Medium / High): Controls how strong the upsides can be and how harsh the trade-offs are.

Complexity (Simple / Standard / Complex): Controls number of modifiers/triggers and how “compound” the ability becomes.

Synergy Bias (Off / On): Increases chance of generating abilities matching a chosen build theme tag (e.g., lightning, bleed).

(Optional later) Progress stage / rarity weighting / banned tags.

Risk Review (1–3 risks + next steps)

Balance Risk: Random combinations might create obviously broken or useless abilities.

Next step: introduce a clearer power budget (costs for verbs/modifiers and negative cost for constraints) and clamp numbers by tier.

Readability Risk: Complex abilities could become too wordy or hard to understand quickly.

Next step: enforce a two-line description rule, plus standardized phrasing and tag icons.

Variety Risk: Outputs could feel samey if pools are too small.

Next step: expand component pools and add “signature patterns” (e.g., chain + shock, bleed + execute) and rarity-only effects.

Plan Before Midterm Showcase

Add a simple UI (dropdowns for parameters + “Generate x10” button).

Expand pools (verbs/modifiers/constraints) and implement a basic power-budget pass.

Produce 20+ example outputs with different parameter settings.
